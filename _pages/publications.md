## Research Themes

My research focuses on three interconnected areas:

1. **Differential Privacy for Correlated Data**: Developing frameworks that maintain privacy guarantees in datasets with complex interdependencies
2. **Edge Computing for Privacy**: Leveraging distributed computing architectures to protect data at its source
3. **Participatory AI**: Creating democratic and accessible privacy-preserving systems for public benefit
