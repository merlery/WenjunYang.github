I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Tacoma, with a strong focus on Internet of Things (IoT), Distributed Systems, and Differential Privacy. My research aims to develop advanced privacy-preserving frameworks that protect sensitive data while maintaining its utility for analysis and decision-making.

## Research Interests

My primary research focuses on **differential privacy for correlated data**, particularly in IoT and networked environments. I am developing novel approaches that leverage edge computing to safeguard data privacy at its origin while balancing the critical trade-off between privacy protection and data utility.

Key areas of expertise include:
- **Differential Privacy**: Advanced frameworks for privacy-preserving data analysis
- **Internet of Things**: Edge computing and distributed data processing
- **Distributed Systems**: Scalable and efficient system architectures
- **Participatory AI**: Democratic frameworks for public decision-making

## Current Research

I am currently working on **CorrelaPriv**, an advanced differential privacy framework designed specifically for correlated data. This work has resulted in multiple publications, including:
- A framework accepted in IEEE Transactions on Privacy
- A participatory AI framework presented at the 2025 ACM CHI Workshop
- An optimization method published at the 2024 IEEE AIIoT Congress

## Academic Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science and Systems (GPA 3.72/4.0) and a Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering from the University of Washington. Throughout my academic career, I have been recognized with multiple scholarships including the Graduates Merit Scholarship (2019, 2022, 2023) and the Carwein-Andrews Award (2024).

## Recent Achievements

- **First Prize** at the 2019 University of Washington Tacoma annual Hackathon for **StreetSmarter**, a navigation-based smart parking system
- Multiple peer-reviewed publications in top-tier conferences and journals
- Maintaining a strong academic record with a current GPA of 3.95/4.0

## Beyond Research

I am passionate about developing practical solutions to real-world problems. My work bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, with a particular focus on making privacy-preserving technologies accessible and useful for society.
