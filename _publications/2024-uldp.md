## Abstract

Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has emerged as a powerful tool for privacy-preserving data collection, but existing approaches often apply uniform privacy budgets across all users and data types. This paper introduces ULDP, a user-centric optimization method that allows for flexible privacy budget allocation based on individual preferences and data characteristics, achieving better utility without compromising privacy guarantees.

## Key Contributions

- User-centric privacy budget allocation mechanism
- Optimization framework for heterogeneous privacy preferences
- Improved utility bounds for local differential privacy
- Practical implementation guidelines for IoT systems
- Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets
