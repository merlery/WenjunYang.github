## Abstract

Data correlation presents unique challenges for differential privacy mechanisms. This paper introduces MIC-DP, a novel framework that leverages the Mutual Information Coefficient to quantify and address correlation in datasets while maintaining formal privacy guarantees. Our approach achieves superior privacy-utility trade-offs compared to traditional methods, particularly in networked and IoT environments where data interdependencies are common.

## Key Contributions

- Novel correlation-aware differential privacy mechanism
- Mutual Information Coefficient-based correlation quantification
- Adaptive noise injection strategy for correlated data
- Theoretical privacy guarantees with improved utility bounds
- Experimental validation on real-world datasets
